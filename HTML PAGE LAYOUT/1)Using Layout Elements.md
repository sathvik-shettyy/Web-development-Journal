Utilizing Layout Elements:
• In HTML, the <div> tag serves the purpose of defining a section within your document.
• This tag allows the grouping of extensive HTML elements, enabling their formatting through CSS.
• Tag name: <div> </div>
• It's important to note that the div tag is employed with block-level elements, distinguishing it from the span tag, which is specifically used with inline elements.
• Additional insights on the distinction between the div and span tags in HTML can be found at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-div-and-span-tag-in-html/.
• Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <div style="border:1px solid pink;padding:20px;font-size:20px">
    <p>Welcome to Web Lecture. Here you can find tutorials on the latest technologies.</p>
    <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

• Class Attribute of `<div>`
• The class attribute within the `<div>` tag serves as a distinctive identifier within the document. This attribute facilitates the association of a class name in the CSS, allowing the creation of specific styles for the `<div>` element. Additionally, referencing a particular `<div>` by its class name is possible in jQuery, among other applications. Example: `<div class=" ">`

• CSS Styling in the Class Attribute of `<div>`
• In CSS, you can establish a class that encompasses styles for multiple `<div>` tags, with the class name matching that in the class attribute. This class name is then utilized in the CSS style section, either within the HTML head tag or in an external CSS file. In CSS, a class is denoted by a dot (.), such as .divclass.

• Understanding `<div>` ID
• The ID attribute, another attribute of the `<div>` tag, acts as a unique identifier in the HTML document. IDs can be employed in CSS and referenced in jQuery, providing a distinct means of identification. Example: `<div id=" ">`

• Example: `<div>` with ID Attribute and CSS
• Utilizing the same code as in the previous example showcasing the `<div>` class, we can reference the ID in CSS by prefixing it with a hash (#) sign, followed by the ID name.

Here's an example illustrating the use of the class and ID attributes in HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    /* CSS for the Class Attribute */
    .highlight {
      background-color: yellow;
      font-weight: bold;
    }

    /* CSS for the ID Attribute */
    #specialDiv {
      border: 2px solid blue;
      padding: 10px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <!-- Example of Class Attribute -->
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>This div has the 'highlight' class, applying a yellow background and bold text.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Example of ID Attribute -->
  <div id="specialDiv">
    <p>This div has the 'specialDiv' ID, applying a blue border and additional padding.</p>
  </div>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the class attribute is used to apply a specific style to the first `<div>` with the class "highlight". The second `<div>` utilizes the ID attribute "specialDiv" to apply a different set of styles. The corresponding CSS rules in the head section define the styles for these classes and IDs.
